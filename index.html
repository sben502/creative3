        <p>   The perfect acai bowl for the perfect late weekend morning. This acai is very filling, nutrious, and rich in Zinc, Iron and many vitamins. Acai bowls are very filling and can be eaten at any time of the day. The fun thing about it is that you can experiment all the different fruits and flavors while doing at home! We usually have this for breakfast on Saturdays when we ave more time to prepare our breakfast rather than on weekdays...</p>

        <p>   ...Italian lunch that's colorful and considered a fun a good daytime date idea with your loved one. We first tried this meal when we were in Rome in the summer. A family friend invited us over and we all cooked together these amazing dishes. Of course this dish was the main dish and it is in tradition that the person who cooked it takes the the first bite... </p>

        <p>   ...A nice vegan lunch when you're on the go and don't have time to prepare a big meal. The more greens in the salad, the more nutrious it is and more filled with anti-oxidents. Some people have different diets, and more people are going vegan by the day. We love vegan food, and a lot of people think vegan food is bland, but we very much recommand this bowl... </p>
